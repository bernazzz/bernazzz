- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... With Russian Intelegence Services, im willing to do everything you ask me for, I already fought in World War 1 in 1st Battalion Delta Rangers in Battle of Caporetto (October 24–December 19, 1917), and World War 2 The Siege of Leningrad: September 1941—January 1944 as 7 companion from Rangers Marines 1st battalion as Squad Leader Engineer. I've been fighting as long with King Arthur and helped Merlin call Transformers to help us from getting invade from Western Countrys. I've been able to be one of the greatest samurais in Third Battle of Uji, 1221

In 1221, the country was run by a regent on behalf of a weak Shogun. The ex-emperor Go-Toba tried to regain control on behalf of his son, rebelling against the officials who supposedly served him.

The rebellion ended on July 5. Go-Toba’s inexperienced and intimidated army retreated to the Uji river. Although they inflicted heavy casualties on their foes, they were defeated. The ex-emperor’s rebellion was at an end.
